# Zachary Milos Moore's Personal Website
This is a personal website I use to showcase some of my personal work. 

I created this from an R Markdown website template [https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html) and was partially inspired by the work of Steffi LaZerte for aspects of formatting [https://github.com/steffilazerte].
