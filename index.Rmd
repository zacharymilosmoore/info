# **Home**

I am an environmental professional specializing in ecology, ecological restoration, and data analysis. Currently, I am working to identify areas that are disproportionately important for biodiversity conservation in Canada through my [work on the Key Biodiversity Areas Project](https://kbacanada.org/) with [Wildlife Conservation Society Canada](https://www.wcs.org/). I also volunteer with the [Society for Conservation Biology North America (SCB-NA)](https://scbnorthamerica.org/) and I teach courses in the Ecological Restoration and Environmental Technician programs at [Niagara College Canada](https://www.niagaracollege.ca/). I additionally take on data consulting work here or there for specific and interesting projects, so please get in touch if you'd like to work together.
