I am an environmental professional specializing in conservation biology, ecology, ecological restoration, and natural resources management. I am currently studying at the University of Manitoba in conjunction with the [Nature Conservancy of Canada](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/) as a [Conservation Science Fellow](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/conservation-research/weston-fellowship.html), and my research focuses on grassland bird conservation on private conservation rangelands in southwestern Alberta, Canada. 

Currently, I work for [Wildlife Conservation Society Canada](https://www.wcs.org/) as the [Regional Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Coordinator for Manitoba](https://kbacanada.org/), where I create proposals to recognize areas that disproportionately important for species-at-risk conservation for use in future land use planning and conservation.
